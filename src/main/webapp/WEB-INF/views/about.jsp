			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>A history of tradition for over 80 years. The Mushroom Company
				(formerly Mushroom Canning Company) had been part of the history of
				Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, the "Mushroom Capital of the World,"
				for over 70 years.</p>

			<p>By the mid 1920's, Southeastern, Pennsylvania produced 90% of
				all the mushrooms cultivated in this country. In 1926, a group of
				growers from the Kennett Square area banded to form an Association.
				While helping its members to market their mushrooms more
				efficiently, the Association also made contributions to aid in
				mushroom research and worked to obtain legislation to protect the
				domestic mushroom industry.</p>

			<p>In 2006, we decided to update the name of the company from
				"Mushroom Canning Company" to "The Mushroom Company" to better
				reflect and encompass the products that we offer. We wanted everyone
				to know we are much more than just a canning company.</p>

			<h2>A Commitment to Quality</h2>

			<p>Today, as in 1931, quality is still the key word. All
				mushrooms used are subjected to repeated inspections as they pass
				through the plant. Our company and growers continually work with
				Pennsylvania State University in developing new processing
				techniques and ways of growing the best mushrooms possible.</p>

			<p>The Mushroom Company's uncompromising fresh product quality
				and strict processing procedures combine to insure that our
				mushrooms rival the freshly picked ones in flavor, texture, and
				color. Mushrooms used in both the canning and freezing operation are
				subjected to repeated inspections as they pass through the plant.
				Mushrooms not meeting The Mushroom Company's high standard for
				freezing or canning are removed. Mushrooms judged to be ideal are
				now ready to be prepared to the end-user's requirement.</p>


			<h2>A Focus on the Future</h2>

			<p>We at The Mushroom Company realize that our 75-year history is
				a result of satisfied customers, and customer satisfaction remains
				the primary focus of the people at The Mushroom Company.</p>
